## 🎯 What It Does

This app takes in customer-related features (like average order value,preferred category etc.) and predicts whether the transaction is **fraudulent or not** using a trained machine learning model. It's built using Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn.

Great for learning or demonstrating basic classification models in a real-world use case.
